## ✨ What Makes Party Parrot Special

### 🎛️ **Intelligent DMX Lighting Control**
Party Parrot doesn't just flash lights to the beat—it **understands** your music:
- **Real-time audio analysis** with advanced beat detection, frequency separation, and energy tracking
- **Automatic scene generation** that creates unique lighting combinations for every song
- **Smart transitions** that shift between looks based on musical dynamics
- **Energy-aware programming** that intensifies during drops and pulls back during breakdowns
- **Never repeats** the same combination—always fresh, always evolving

### 🎨 **Professional VJ Visuals**
A complete GPU-accelerated visual system running at **870+ FPS**:
- **Dynamic video playback** from themed video collections (warehouse raves, neon streets, church raves, vintage horror, and more)
- **30+ real-time effects**: Bloom, camera zoom/shake, datamosh, RGB shift, pixelation, scanlines, hot sparks, CRT mask, vintage film, color strobes, and more
- **3D virtual lighting fixtures** with volumetric beam rendering and haze effects
- **Beat-synchronized effects** that pulse, strobe, and evolve with the music
- **Text overlays** with animated color effects
- **Layer compositing** for complex multi-effect combinations
- **Oscilloscope visualization** for that analog synth aesthetic

### 🎪 **Extensive Fixture Support**
Works with a massive range of professional DMX fixtures:
- **Moving Heads**: Chauvet Intimidator series (Spot 110, 120, 160), Rogue Beam R2, MoveWhite 9
- **LED Pars**: RGB and RGBA color mixing, strobe effects
- **Lasers**: Chauvet, Oultia, and UKing laser systems
- **Effect Lights**: Rotospheres, Derby effects, Color Band Pix
- **Atmospheric Effects**: Motion strips, stage blinders
- **Complete rigs**: Chauvet GigBar support

### 🌈 **Adaptive Color Schemes**
Intelligent color management that creates cohesive looks:
- **Theme-based palettes**: Automatically generates complementary color schemes
- **Smooth transitions** between color schemes
- **Rainbow mode support** for high-energy moments
- **Color coordination** across all fixtures and visuals

### 🎭 **Multiple Performance Modes**
Switch between modes for different vibes:
- **Party Mode**: High-energy lighting with aggressive beat detection
- **Rave Mode**: Maximum intensity with all effects engaged
- **Twinkle Mode**: Gentle, ambient lighting for mellow moments

### 📱 **Mobile Web Interface**
Control everything from your phone or tablet:
- **Remote mode switching** from any device on your network
- **Real-time updates** with thread-safe state management
- **Clean, mobile-optimized UI**
- **Custom port configuration**

### 🎯 **Smart Behavior**
Party Parrot watches your music and adapts:
- **Automatic scene shifts** every 60 seconds during quiet moments (never mid-drop!)
- **Hype detection** that escalates intensity during peak energy
- **Signal routing** that ensures every frequency range is always represented
- **Warmup period** for smooth startup transitions
- **Position management** for spatial effects across multiple fixtures

## 🏗️ Architecture

Party Parrot is built on a sophisticated, modular architecture:

### Director System
The **Director** is the brain that coordinates everything:
- Manages fixture groups and interpreters
- Generates color schemes and transitions
- Coordinates timing and scene shifts
- Bridges DMX lighting and VJ visuals
- Handles mode switching and state management

### Interpreter Pipeline
Each fixture group gets its own **Interpreter** that translates music into light:
- Base interpreters for different fixture types
- Composite interpreters that chain effects
- Signal-driven interpreters that respond to specific frequencies
- Latched interpreters that hold states
- Randomization for organic variation

### VJ Graph System
A node-based rendering pipeline for visuals:
- **BaseInterpretationNode**: Composable effects that transform video frames
- **Fixture renderers**: 3D volumetric lighting simulation
- **Layer composition**: Stack effects like Photoshop layers
- **Mode switching**: Different visual styles for different modes
- **Recursive generation**: Partial or complete scene regeneration

### State Management
Thread-safe state with event-driven updates:
- Mode, theme, and venue selection
- Hype levels and limiters
- Manual dimmer control
- Web interface integration
- Keyboard shortcuts

---

## 🎛️ Hardware Setup

### Required
- **Mac or Linux** (tested on macOS)
- **USB Audio Interface** for microphone input
- **Entec DMX USB Pro** (or compatible) for DMX output
- **DMX fixtures** connected via standard DMX cables

### Optional

  bg_hiphop/       # Hip-hop specific visuals
  bg_music_vid/    # Music video footage
```

Party Parrot will intelligently select and transition between videos based on the current mode and energy level.

### Creating Venue Patches
Define your fixture setup in `patch_bay.py`:
```python
venue_patches = {
    "my_venue": [
        MovingHead(address=1, name="Stage Left"),
        MovingHead(address=20, name="Stage Right"),
        Par(address=40, name="Front Wash"),
        Laser(address=100, name="Crowd Laser"),
    ]
}
```

### Contributing
Party Parrot follows strict development practices:
- **Type enforcement** with beartype decorators
- **No silent failures**: Code should fail loudly and clearly
- **Comprehensive tests**: Test complex logic, not trivial code
- **Clean code**: Avoid hasattr/try-except fallbacks, use precise typing
- **Run before commit**: Always test with `just launch` and `just test`
